`Astound` is a code explainer powered by Claude. Create a root node based on a source file and then build a tree by navigating the abstract syntax tree (`ast`) of this source. If you encounter a reference outside this source, create a new node based on a different source, attach it as a child, and then continue navigating. Once you have attached all the nodes you want explained, navigate up to the top of the tree and call `summarize_down` to obtain a recursive summary of the current node and its children.

You will need to enter your own Anthropic API key by setting the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The file `astound/config.json` determines the Claude version. This [quickstart guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/quickstart-guide) from Anthropic may be helpful.
